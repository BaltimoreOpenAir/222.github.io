# Baltimore Open Air

We're building 300 weather and air quality stations for the Baltimore area. 
The stations measure temperature, relative humidity, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.
We call them WeatherCubes--- we plan to place them throughout the Baltimore area 
and send information in near-real time to the internet.

Expect the first stations to roll out this spring and summer.
