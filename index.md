# Baltimore Open Air

We're building 300 weather and air quality stations for the Baltimore area 
using a device we designed that we call our WeatherCubes.
They measure temperature, relative humidity, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.
The WeatherCubes will be placed outside throughout the Baltimore area 
and send information in near-real time to the internet.
